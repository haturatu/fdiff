A simple file difference tracker. It helps you track changes in your files by maintaining an index of file hashes.  
Extracts only Gitâ€™s diff detection functionality, and can be faster than Git in some cases.  
Since it processes asynchronously, daemonization is not required, making it a good choice if you prefer not to use tools like `inotifywait`.  

## Installation

To build the project, run:
```bash
make
```

To install the binary to `/usr/local/bin`, run:
```bash
sudo make install
```

## Uninstallation
To uninstall the binary, run:
```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## Usage

`fdiff` works by maintaining an index of files in a `.fdiff` directory. You first need to initialize it, then you can add files and check their status.

### Initialize

Initializes a new fdiff repository in the current directory. This creates a `.fdiff` directory.
```bash
fdiff init
```

### Add files

Adds one or more files or directories to be tracked.
```bash
fdiff add <path>...
```
For example, to add all files in the `src` directory:
```bash
fdiff add src
```
or to add current directory:
```bash
fdiff add .
```

### Check status

Shows the status of tracked files, indicating new, modified, or deleted files.
```bash
fdiff status
```
