# fdiff
A simple file difference tracker. It helps you track changes in your files by maintaining an index of file hashes.  
Extracts only Gitâ€™s diff detection functionality, and can be faster than Git in some cases.  
Since it processes asynchronously, daemonization is not required, making it a good choice if you prefer not to use tools like `inotifywait`.  

## Features
- **Fast**: Uses file hashes to quickly determine changes.
- **Simple**: Easy to use with a straightforward command-line interface.
- **No Daemon**: Operates without needing a background service, making it lightweight.
- **Status Codes**: Provides clear exit codes for script integration.
- **Use strlcpy/strlcat**: Ensures safe string operations to prevent buffer overflows.
  
Thanks to OpenBSD for the `strlcpy` and `strlcat` functions, which are used to safely copy and concatenate strings, preventing buffer overflows.  

As shown below, each execution is assigned a status code, allowing flexible branching in shell scripts.

```
#define EXIT_OK 0
#define EXIT_FAIL 1
#define EXIT_NOFILE 3
#define EXIT_INTERNAL 4
#define EXIT_ALREADY_INITIALIZED 5
#define EXIT_ALREADY_ADDED 6
#define EXIT_DIFF_FOUND 7
```

example usage:
```bash
$ echo $?
0
$ fdiff init
Already initialized.
$ echo $?
5
$ fdiff add .
$ echo $?
0
$ fdiff add .
$ echo $?
6
```

## Installation

To build the project, run:
```bash
make
```

To install the binary to `/usr/local/bin`, run:
```bash
sudo make install
```

## Uninstallation
To uninstall the binary, run:
```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## Usage

`fdiff` works by maintaining an index of files in a `.fdiff` directory. You first need to initialize it, then you can add files and check their status.

### Initialize

Initializes a new fdiff repository in the current directory. This creates a `.fdiff` directory.
```bash
fdiff init
```

### Add files

Adds one or more files or directories to be tracked.
```bash
fdiff add <path>...
```
For example, to add all files in the `src` directory:
```bash
fdiff add src
```
or to add current directory:
```bash
fdiff add .
```

### Check status

Shows the status of tracked files, indicating new, modified, or deleted files.
```bash
fdiff status
```
